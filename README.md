# CS3560_Assignment2
NOTE: In the demo I did not go over the Positive Percentage button because I did not get around to fully being able to support that functionality, also my news feed includes only tweets that the user him/herself tweets, did not figure out how to incorporate tweets from other users into the listview.
Also, my screen recording didn't capture everything for some reason, when I added the users/groups and clicked on the buttons to view statistics new pop-ups would open up but I couldn't figure a workaround in time to capture everything in the demo unfortunately.
